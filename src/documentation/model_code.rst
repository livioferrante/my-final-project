.. _model_code:

Model code
**********


The directory *src/model_code* contains source files that might differ by model and which are potentially used at various steps of the analysis.

For example, you may have a Stata program that is used both in the :ref:`analysis` and the :ref:`final` steps. The conceptual distinction to the *src/library* directory is not entirely clear, but I find it useful at times to think of the library to contain only general-purpose code.
